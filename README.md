Number #1
 On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit 
 and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. 
Adding these together produces 142.

Number #2

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled
out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as 
valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit
on each line. For example:

two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76.
Adding these together produces 281.
